## 🚀 Features

* **🕵️ Immersive Hacker UI:** Custom "Matrix Rain" background using HTML5 Canvas, glowing CRT typography, and CSS animations.
* **🧩 Multi-Level Cryptography Puzzles:**
    * **Level 1 (Low):** Caesar Cipher (Classical shift encryption).
    * **Level 2 (Medium):** Binary Translation (Raw data decoding).
    * **Level 3 (High):** XOR Image Steganography (File corruption and restoration).
* **📂 Modular Architecture:** Built on Flask Blueprints for scalable code organization (Auth, Views, Logic).
* **💾 Mock Database System:** Lightweight, file-based data structure (no SQL setup required) for easy deployment and testing.
* **🏆 Mission Logs:** Successful hacks generate downloadable "Mission Reports" (`.txt`) as proof of penetration.

🎮 Operational Guide
Phase 1: Target Selection
Navigate to the Accounts page. You will see a list of targets with varying security levels.

James Ceaser (Low): Requires shifting letters to reveal the password.

Bin Askal (Medium): Requires translating binary to ASCII.

Classified Image (High): Requires external file manipulation.

Phase 2: The Image Puzzle (Target ID: 03)
Navigate to the Classified Image login page.

Click the orange [ DOWNLOAD ENCRYPTED DATA ] button to acquire encrypted_image.bin.

Write a Python script (or use the provided tool) to XOR the file using the password found in the source code or clues.

Key: download

Once decrypted, the image will reveal visual confirmation. Enter the key into the login field to penetrate the system.

Phase 3: Exfiltration
Upon successful login, download the Mission Report text file to confirm your objective is complete.
